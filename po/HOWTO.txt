paths2openscad.pot serves as a template for new *.po files. It can be refreshed
or generated with the command 'make extract'.
The Makefile contains all the needed magic to get intltools and gettext going.

Then you can copy this template to a new $LANG.po file and start translating there.

additional paths2openscad-$LANG.inx files can be placed next to the original
paths2openscad.inx file in the extensions directory.  Their 'id' element should
be changed to include the language. Then inkscape will show both in the menue.
If the 'id' remains unchanged, inkscape will show two identical entries in the menue.

For normal use, only the one *.inx file for the desired language should be installed.
